Turing Machine for Accepting Odd Palindromes

Overview :
This project presents the design and implementation of a Turing Machine capable of recognizing and accepting odd palindromes. An odd palindrome is defined as a string that reads the same backward as forward and has an odd number of characters. This Turing Machine demonstrates the principles of automata theory and highlights how computational models can be applied to solve complex language recognition problems.

Objectives :
To design and implement a Turing Machine that correctly identifies and accepts strings that are odd palindromes.
To demonstrate the use of states, transitions, and logic within a Turing Machine framework to perform string recognition.
To handle various edge cases, including single-character strings and nested palindrome structures.
Features :
Comprehensive State Design: Detailed states and transitions have been developed to ensure the accurate recognition of odd palindromes.
Efficient Operations: Optimized logic minimizes unnecessary computations, making the Turing Machine efficient even for large input strings.
Robust Testing: Extensive testing has been carried out with various inputs to validate the functionality and reliability of the Turing Machine.
Detailed Documentation: Clear explanations of the design, state transitions, logic flow, and handling of input cases are provided to enhance understanding and reproducibility.

How It Works:
The Turing Machine operates by:

Scanning the input string from both ends.
Comparing characters symmetrically around a central character to check for palindrome properties.
Ensuring the input string has an odd number of characters.
Accepting or rejecting the input based on whether it satisfies the odd palindrome condition.
